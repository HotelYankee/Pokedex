# Pokemon Searcher
User Story:
As a PokÃ©mon collector
I want a web application where I can view different PokÃ©mon cards to compare stats & types.
So that I can make informed decisions on which cards would best fit my current deck.

We built this Pokedex using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

The spp functions as a serch engine for different pokemon. After typing the Pokemons name and clicking search the Pokemon will be displayed as a card with its stats. The purpose is to help pokemeon colectors make informed decisions on hat cards to add to their decks, & or to just have fun viewing the different types.
